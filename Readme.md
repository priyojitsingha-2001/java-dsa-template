## 🌟 Overview

This repository contains a basic setup to compile and run Java programs within Visual Studio Code. It includes a sample configuration file for the VSCode tasks.json file. This configuration allows you to compile and run Java programs with input taken from `input.txt` and output directed to `output.txt`.

## 💡 How to Use

To use this template:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Place your Java source files in the project's root directory or in a subfolder.
3. Create an `input.txt` file in the project's root directory to provide input data for your Java program.
4. Open a Java source file in Visual Studio Code.
5. Right-click inside the source file and select "Run Build Task" (or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+B`) to compile and run your Java program.
6. The program's output will be written to the `output.txt` file.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `.vscode`: Contains configuration files for Visual Studio Code.
  - `tasks.json`: Defines a build task to compile and run Java programs with input and output files.
- `input.txt`: Placeholder for input data.
- `output.txt`: Placeholder for program output.
- (Your Java source files): Place your Java source code files here.

## 🛠️ Customize

You can customize this template by:

- Adding your Java source code files to the project.
- Modifying the `input.txt` file to provide different input data.
- Running more complex Java programs by updating the `tasks.json` file to include additional arguments or commands.
